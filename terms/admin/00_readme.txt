Some question from cip to the linguists concerning the newly
acquired FAD-data with both nob and sme as simplicia:

1. are all forms (both nob and sme) ok, i.e., can we just add those lemmata
to a regular dict?
2. are the rest-attribut still necessary or can be deleted?

(1) both nob and sme are simple lemmma:
src/fad_nobsme.20121130_merged_simp.xml
 ==> done (modulo the questions above)

(2) nob simple but at least one sme complex:
src/fad_nobsme.20121130_merged_only-sme-comp.xml
 ==> done

ap_lexifyIt/nobsme_sme-comps_lex.xml
 ==> todo

(3) both nob and sme are complex:
src/fad_nobsme.20121130_merged_comp.xml
 ==> todo         

Lesson learned: don't merge entries that have to be lexified!
