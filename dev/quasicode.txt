Quasicode for translating
words/dicts/smenob/src/smenob.xml
to
words/dicts/nobsme/src/nobsme.xml

and similarily for the file
words/dicts/smenob/src/smenob.dtd
words/dicts/smenob/src/smenob.xsl
words/dicts/smenob/src/smenob.css

The general idea is to take each translation in each entry, 
make the lemma a translation, keep all grammatical info on
both lemma and translation, keep the examples, but switch them.
The resulting nobsme.xml will have many homonym lemmas. They should 
be unified, and then manually edited.

For each <e> in smenob.xml, 
make each <t> into a <l> in a new <e> in nobsme.xml
pick the <l> in smenob.xml as the <t> of the new <e>
In case of a <xg>, switch <x> and <xt>

Then, for the resulting nobsme.xml, unify all entries with identical
<l pos="...">, making each
